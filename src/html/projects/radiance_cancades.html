								Final project for the Advanced Rendering Techniques class. I implemented Radiance Cascades (RCs) and wrote a report introducing 2D Radiance Cascades, 
								a global illumination technique that simulates penumbra effects. The report covers the fundamental principles of this
								technique and provides an overview of the implementation details. Additionally, it discusses issues encountered during the implementation 
								and offers some optimizations to improve both performance and visual quality. The 2D framework was created from  scrath using C++ and OpenGL.

									<h3>Small introduction</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Radiance cascades, introduced by Alexander Sannikov, are a memory-efficient data structure designed for real-time global
									illumination calculations. This structure decomposes a radiance field into multiple cascades, with each cascade storing
									different radiance information. The lowest cascade captures high spatial frequencies, while higher cascades focus on lower
									spatial frequencies and increased angular resolution. This is based on the Penumbra condition, which states that closer light
									sources need higher linear resolution, while distant sources require higher angular resolution.

								</p>
								<p>
									In practice, radiance cascades store radiance values in probes across different cascades. The lowest cascade (cascade 0)
									has the highest spatial resolution and is denser in probes to capture fine details. Higher cascades reduce the number of
									probes while improving angular resolution to capture light from more distant parts of the scene.

									<h3>Steps followed</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									To implement the demo, I followed the approach outlined by <a href="https://jason.today/rc" target="_blank">JasonToday</a>. The process began by creating a drawing
									canvas where mouse positions and clicks are tracked to paint fragments. On the fragment shader, the screen space position
									is calculated using the UV coordinates, and if the position lies within the segment, the fragment is painted. The canvas
									supports loading scenes with custom screen resolutions and shapes, serving as a basic framework for drawing, as shown in
									Figure.
								</p>

								<p>
									Next, I implemented optimizations for the distance field using the Jumping Flood Algorithm (JFA). The painted pixels are
									stamped onto a new texture, called "jfaSeed", and the algorithm propagates the distance field by iterating through multiple
									passes, gradually converging on the closest painted pixel. This approach uses a ping-pong technique to alternate between
									textures during the passes, as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:Image3}. Once the JFA texture is generated, the distance field
									is computed by calculating the distance between each UV coordinate and the closest painted pixel.

								</p>
								<a href="#" class="image"><img src="../../../data/images/RC_jfa.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									Finally, to take advantage of the Penumbra hypothesis for global illumination, I implemented radiance cascades with varying
									spatial and angular resolutions. Each cascade has a specific probe count, with higher cascades reducing probe density but
									increasing angular resolution. The radiance is accumulated through ray marching, using the distance field to find the nearest
									surface. During the rendering, the current cascade is merged with the previous one by sampling from both cascades and averaging
									the results. The entire process is illustrated in Figure ~\ref{fig:Image6}, where probe data and ray-marching details are shown.

									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The implementation successfully models global illumination for a 2D scene using radiance cascades. The demo simulates 
									light propagation and the penumbra effect. The results shown in the introductory figure demonstrate how this technique
									simulates lighting, and how light propagation and soft shadowing can be achieved in real-time using this technique.
								</p>
								<p>
									Future work will involve extending this technique to a 2D arcade game using Vulkan.
